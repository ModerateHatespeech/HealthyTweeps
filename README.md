# HealthyTweeps

Chrome extension to hide toxic content from Twitter

## Configuration

**Sensitivity:** The sensitivity of the filter determines how content should be hidden. A higher sensitivity hides more potentially-hateful content while a lower sensitivity takes a more conservative approach.

## Data

Tweet content is sent to [ModerateHatespeech](https://moderatehatespeech.com/)'s Toxicity API. No text content is logged or stored and all personal data is completely confidential

## Censorship

The purpose of this tool is to provide a more positive Twitter viewing experiencing. Significant work has been done to reduce the impact of [potential biases](https://moderatehatespeech.com/framework/), especially towards a specific identity and ideology. The issue of censorhip inevitably arises when it comes to content moderation and while our purpose isn't to curate content in a specific way, we understand that such an unintended risk will always be present.

A warning will be displayed whenever any content has been filtered, and hovering over the warning will show the filtered tweet.
